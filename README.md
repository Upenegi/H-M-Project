## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing H&M's product and customer datasets to gain insights into their product offerings and customer demographics. The primary goals include understanding the distribution of products, exploring customer attributes, and identifying patterns that can inform business decisions.

## Data Understanding

In this section, we load the product and customer datasets, examine their structure, and perform basic exploratory analysis.

- `product_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code to explore and visualize product-related data.
- `customer_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code to analyze customer demographics.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring the datasets for analysis. In this section, we clean missing values, rename columns, and perform data transformations.

- `data_preparation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data cleaning and preparation.

## Data Analysis

This section focuses on analyzing the data and generating insights using various charts and visualizations.

- `product_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with product-related analysis and visualizations.
- `customer_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with customer demographics analysis and visualizations.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored H&M's product and customer datasets, providing valuable insights into product distribution, customer attributes, and more. These insights can be utilized to make informed business decisions and enhance the customer experience.
